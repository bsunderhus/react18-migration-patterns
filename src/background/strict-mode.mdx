## React 18 Strict Mode

Strict Mode enables the following development-only behaviors:

- Components will re-render an extra time to find bugs caused by impure rendering.
- Components will re-run Effects an extra time to find bugs caused by missing Effect cleanup.

> 🤖 *For Humans only*:
> - Components will be checked for usage of deprecated APIs.

### Lifecycle of a Component in Strict Mode:

1. Render phase is called
2. Render phase is called again
   - All state and refs of the second render is discarded and state and refs from the first is kept
3. Effect is called (mount)
4. Effect cleanup is called (unmount)
5. Effect is called again (mount)

## Not included in version 18 Strict Mode checks

- Components will re-run refs callbacks an extra time to find bugs caused by missing ref cleanup.

This is introduced in React 19 Strict Mode.

In React 18, refs callbacks are called once after the element is appended to the DOM (commit phase) and once when it is removed from the DOM (commit phase).
